       <div class="Mess">  With all the issues we encounter in life, do we ever honestly question whether God is real ?
        If he has ears to hear, a voice to respond to our requests, and a heart to show us mercy?
        The typical causes for why so many individuals lose faith in life and entirely give up on it include
        being constantly exhausted,
        having a lot of negative thoughts, such as money and
        family issues, as well as being broken sometimes, which is some people blaming God for that happening and for not assisting those who are facing difficulties.
    We all experience moments when we question our existence, our origins, and our purpose in life.
         Did we come into this world just to feel pain? Oppressed by the enemy? fail to succeed? be futile in all endeavors? 
         If so, how? Perhaps it occurs as a result of our hearts being estranged from God.
          We prefer to question the Lord rather than being grateful for the things that are visible and provided to us.
                
         </div>
         <div class="Mess2">
            When we are facing problems in life, it can be difficult to believe that God has a plan through every challenge that we face.
             We can be tempted to believe that God is more interested in punishing us than in helping us. 
             We can be tempted to believe that God would rather see us struggle than conquer. Whatever the particular struggle we face, the question of suffering is one of the hardest of all and one of
              the biggest barriers to faith in God. Some of us may even have written God off because of the things we have been through.
              If God existed, He surely would not have let that happen.
        </div>
        <div class="Mess3">God is constant, regardless of our circumstances. God's role does not alter despite the fact that our 
             in this world may. The eternally gracious, sacrificial, and loving God who "being rich in mercy, because of the great
              love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ" <spam> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202%3A4-5&version=NIV" target="_blank">  (Eph. 2:4-5)</a> </spam> is 
              till the same. For those who are in Christ, the promises of God are "yes" <spam> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=%282+Corinthians+1%3A20%29&version=NIV" target="_blank"> (2 Corinthians 1:20)</a> </spam> . The Israelites 
              received God's promises as "yes" while they followed His commands. However, that does not imply that God gave 
              them easy access to the Promised Land. Israel had to put their faith in God. 
            Israel still needed to acquire some territory in the Promised Land after Joshua passed away. God tested them to 
            see if His assurances of His presence, deliverance, and faithfulness were sufficient for them by not completely
             conquering the area at once. Unfortunately, they weren't. Israel disregarded God because the iron chariots of the
              Canaanites  <spam> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=judges+1&version=NIV" target="_blank"> (see Judges 1)</a> </spam> appeared to be too terrifying.  Although God has promised to be with us, to deliver us,
               and to be trustworthy, are these assurances sufficient for us? When circumstances push us to doubt God, do we
               still believe Him?  My friend, I urge you to put your trust in the Lord no matter what is difficult for you right now,
                what may feel overwhelming or depressing. His assurances remain valid. He has not left you or forsaken you. He is the
                 same good and loving God.<br>
                 <br>

                 But in the midst of these anxieties, we are reminded that we have the strong refuge, our loving God as we read <spam> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalms+46%3A1&version=NIV" target="_blank"> (Psalms 46:1)</a> </spam> “God is our refuge and strength, 
                 an ever-present help in trouble.” Here God is presented as a refuge and fortress for His people in a time of earthly upheaval.
                 During this time of trial and uncertainty, when many of us are facing a fast-developing reality that 
                 includes physical distancing, loneliness, school and church closures, we have the living refuge, our
                  God who controls the universe. He has manifested himself to be our refuge in the course of His providence 
                  in time past, in time now and He has engaged to be so in time to come, and will never fail to fulfil his engagement. <br><br>

     We all go through tough times. We go through hardships of every kind. There are times when we feel like giving up.
We may become discouraged and don't feel like continuing to fight the battles of life.
We may feel like we are on a treadmill running with everything we have and getting nowhere. Life can become stale and boring.
 Sometimes we may feel as if we can't muster enough energy to continue life's journey.
All of us feel this way at times. No one is exempt from trouble and trials. It happens to the best of people. But we have to 
keep going even though it may seem as if the challenges and demands of life are going to get the best of us.
It is like there is no place to hide when hardships come knocking at our door. No matter how hard we try to keep it out of our 
life, somehow it always manages to find its way in.
 
<br><br>
We have no doubt, He is a Help, a present Help, a Help found, a Help at hand, one 
that is always near; we cannot desire for a better one, nor shall we ever find the like in any creature.
<br><br>
This is the God in whom we trust. Please take care, stay positive and find sometime for having fun and smiling.
